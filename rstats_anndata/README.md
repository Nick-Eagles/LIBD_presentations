This directory contains code exploring basic usage of the `zellkonverter` R package to convert `SummarizedExperiment` derivatives (such as `SingleCellExperiment` and `SpatialExperiment`) to python-based `AnnData`s for downstream analysis.

This code was presented at the [LIBD rstats club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/); this presentation is available on YouTube [here: TODO](). The data used is available [here](http://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/#raw-data), but a script is included as part of this repo to prepare necessary data for users of JHPCE.
